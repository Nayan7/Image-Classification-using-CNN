# Image-Classification-using-CNN
Overview:
This project focuses on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using deep learning techniques. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It's a multi-class classification problem aimed at identifying objects in images.

Approach:
I employed a deep learning algorithm leveraging TensorFlow to tackle this task. The model architecture comprises convolutional neural networks (CNNs) followed by fully connected layers. This architecture is well-suited for learning hierarchical features from images, enabling accurate multi-class classification.

Dataset:
The CIFAR-10 dataset was used, which consists of 60,000 images divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image belongs to one of the following classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.

Model Training:
Data Preprocessing: Images were normalized and augmented to increase the diversity of training data and improve model generalization.
Model Architecture: I implemented a deep learning model with convolutional layers followed by pooling layers for feature extraction and down-sampling. The extracted features were flattened and passed through fully connected layers for classification.
Training Process: The model was trained using the training dataset with techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer. Cross-entropy loss was used as the optimization objective.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate were fine-tuned to optimize model performance.
Evaluation:
Test Accuracy: The model's performance was evaluated using the test dataset. High accuracy indicates the model's ability to classify images accurately across different classes.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix was generated to analyze the model's performance on each class and identify any misclassifications.
Results:
Test Accuracy: 95%

Future Improvements:
Experiment with different CNN architectures such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception for potentially better performance.
Fine-tune hyperparameters further to enhance model generalization and accuracy.
Explore techniques like transfer learning using pre-trained models to leverage knowledge from other domains.
